# AUTO BILL RECEIPT GENERATOR

**Developed By**: Jayshree Chauhan

---

## Aim  
The aim of this project is to develop an automatic bill receipt generator using a predefined file template.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated  
This project showcases the use of the following C programming concepts:

- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.  
- **Pointers**: Efficient memory management and data manipulation.  
- **Strings**: Handling and manipulating text data.  
- **Functions**: Modularizing the code into reusable blocks.  

---

## Project Description  
In this project:

1. A bill template is referenced from a file (`BillTemplate.txt`), which serves as the base structure for the receipt.  
2. The user is prompted to input their name.  
3. Additional predefined strings, such as the **company name**, **bill amount**, and **outlet name**, are incorporated into the receipt.  
4. A new string is generated by combining the user input and predefined data.  
5. The updated data is saved in a new file, creating a complete and personalized bill receipt.  

---

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.  
2. Ensure the file `BillTemplate.txt` exists in the same directory as the program.  
3. Compile the C program using any standard C compiler (e.g., GCC).  
   ```bash
   gcc Auto_Bill_Generator.c -o Auto_Bill_Generator
   ```
4. Run the executable:  
   ```bash
   ./Auto_Bill_Generator
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your name and generate the bill receipt.

## Example Template File (`BillTemplate.txt`)
```text
------------------| [CUSTOMER_NAME]'s Bill |------------------

Company Name: [COMPANY_NAME]
Outlet: [OUTLET_NAME]

Customer Name: [CUSTOMER_NAME]
Bill Amount: [BILL_AMOUNT] Rs.

Thanks [CUSTOMER_NAME] for your purchase! Do visit again.
```

## Sample Output  
When the program runs, it will generate a new file like this:

**Generated File:** `bill.txt`

```text
------------------| Jayshree Chauhan's Bill |------------------

Company Name: GRUB GARAGE
Outlet: BARODA OUTLET

Customer Name: Jayshree Chauhan
Bill Amount: 1000.0 Rs.

Thanks Jayshree Chauhan for your purchase! Do visit again.
```
